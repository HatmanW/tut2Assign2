This is the read me for the Tutorial1B portion of setting up a baseic Django library. 

I'm unsure if this is required but I added it anyway so that a user would not get completely lost.
The contents should be:
Catalog
locallibrary
templates
.getignore (All lower case one word and very important!!!)
db.sqlite3 
Manage.py
README.txt (This readme file)
requirements.txt
